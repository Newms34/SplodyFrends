splodyfrends ideas:

DAMAGE:
1 damage == death IF NOT otherwise protected


WEAPONS/SKILLS
'default' bomb: destroys row & column, deals 1 dmg 

'sacrifice' bomb: destroys all dirt in range (?), deals 1 dmg, kills user. Basically used if you're A) surrounded or B) enemies are hiding

'shield': only available via powerups (see below)/kill #/something else? negates 1 bomb attack (i.e., 1 dmg). 
    - Disappears after 1 attack. Timed? (i.e., if you dont get hit in X seconds, disappears)


TRAPS:
All traps trigger on being walked on. do not trigger if "placer" walks on them. Obtained via powerups

'Damage': deals 1 dmg, unblockable

'Ice': deals no dmg, slows target to 0.5 speed, lasts MEDIUM-SHORT time

'Stun': deals no dmg, lasts SHORT time, enemy cannot move/attack


POWERUPS:
... give one of the upgrades above?

THOUGHTS:
how do we get thru dirt? 
 - some sort of 'dig' functionality
 - two moves to move to dirt cell. First move "breaks" dirt, then cell becomes open at next turn
maybe remove all icons except Astronaut, since we have max of 5 per map
